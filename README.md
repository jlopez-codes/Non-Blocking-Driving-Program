# Non-Blocking-Driving-Program

In  this  assignment  I had to  write a program that does the following: 
-Drives the robot in a continuous square pattern.
-Flashes the LED on and off while driving.
-Responds to pause and resume inputs from the remote control.

This assignment was for my Robotics Engineering Class (RBE2001) where we learned a lot about:
Describe basic terminology related to actuation in the field of robotics.
Synthesize the design of planar mechanisms to complete a task that requires multiple poses (position and orientation).
Formulate the position, velocity, and acceleration kinematics of a mobile robot in 2D space in order to meet design requirements.
Design gears, pins, axles, and linkages to meet safety structural requirements using force and stress analysis.
Specify DC motor torque and speed requirements that meet a specified locomotion or manipulation task.
Write moderately involved programs in embedded C/C++ utilizing state machines to perform specified tasks with a robotic system in real-time.
Specify appropriate electrical system design to convert battery energy into controllable power drive signals to DC motors.  
Construct, program, and test the operation of a mobile robotic system to perform specified tasks. 9.Demonstrate effective teamwork and communication skills through evaluated participation in team presentations/projects.
